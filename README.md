# 🏗️ Cobuild - Modern Construction Landing Page

 ### Cobuild is a sleek, responsive landing page designed for a high-end construction and architectural firm. This project was built to practice integrating Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS3 styling to create a professional user experience.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure for SEO and accessibility.

CSS3: Custom layout design, hero section styling, and interactive hover states.

Bootstrap 5: Utilized for the responsive grid system, navigation, and progress bars.

Google Fonts: Integrated 'Inter' font for a modern, clean look.


## ✨ Key Features
Responsive Navigation: A fixed-top navbar that collapses into a mobile-friendly menu.

Hero Section: A high-impact, full-screen visual entrance with a call-to-action.

Service Grid: A 4-column layout showcasing expertise in Fast Operations, Renovation, Consultation, and Architecture.

Skills Visualizer: Animated-style progress bars displaying professional proficiency levels.

Custom Branding: Overridden Bootstrap defaults with a custom "Warning Yellow" (#f9b000) color palette.

Testimonials: Clean, card-based layout for client feedback.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
During this "just for fun" build, I focused on:

Framework Overrides: Learning how to change Bootstrap's default button colors and borders.

Viewport Units: Using 100vh to ensure the hero section fills the user's screen perfectly.

Layout Logic: Organizing content into logical sections like #services, #skills, and #work for easy navigation.
